These are notes the Alliance's May 19th, 2105 "Kick-Off Meeeting", the first since funding was secured for the Alliance. 

**Agenda: 
I. GDA background and updates
II. Updates from participants
III. Next steps

**I. GDA background and updates**

Three primary work streams to focus on in next 12-18 months (see existing “vision paper” for current baseline)


**1.Producer-to-producer technical assistance**
Problem: inadequate coordination, common challenges yet regular wheel reinvention

Activities: 
- Peer-to-peer help desk function
- “Good practice” identification and dissemination (whether methodology-, technology-, or project management-related)
- Alliance data dashboard (see more below)

**2.Feedback loops**
Problem: 

- producers don’t have a good sense of who data users are and what they need
- users lack consistent means of signaling to producers
- “marketplace” of governance data largely dysfunctional

Main initial activities (led by AidData):
- Mining AidData’s existing dataset (“Reform Efforts Survey 2014”) to draw out actionable information on existing governance data users (both in and outside of government)
- Using survey sample frame/plumbing to do select “Snap Polls” of data users 

**3.Experimental coordinated field work**
Problem: inefficient, costly data collection (leading to inconsistent coverage); failing to take advantage of potential economies of scale
- Likely will start in 2016 in 5-6 countries
- It will involve experimental sharing of resources; striving for demonstrable efficiencies and cost savings

**4. Data Alliance Dashboard**
Problem: how to answer the complex question “How Zambia is doing governance-wise?” 

The dashboard will provide a visual snapshot of existing Alliance member data (at least at the “country score” level). We will be able to 
- say how a country is doing across a number of governance dimensions, above or below (world and/or peer cohort) median, over time 
- offer downloadable snapshots (GIFs, simple csv files, etc.). 

What’s needed to make a minimum viable dashboard happen:
- Data harmonization: agreement on common publication format (e.g. common Alliance-specific spreadsheets)
- Web development
- Time to copy/paste existing data into new Alliance spreadsheets
- Dashboard will be key feature of GDA site (other parts will be simple: who we are; blog, etc.)

Should dashboard provide just a snapshot or also link to broader research / in-depth diagnostic?
- It would be useful to go beyond simple snapshot
- We  should leverage feedback loop efforts to ensure that the dashboard is responsive to needs  (not just producer needs) 
- We need to reflect how data collection can be built to make sure it’s useful to countries; including dashboard


**II. Updates from participants**

Brad Parks, Rebecca Latourell, Samantha Custer - AidData 
Implementation of the Reform Efforts Survey (since September)
- Have not yet studied attributes of users - working on that
- How do you track institutional development/strengthening activities?
- How do we leverage data to produce even better data in the long-term?
- Will organize a meeting to present the “market of ideas [Reform Efforts Survey]” report in DC in June
- Want to collaborate with people from GDA on the feedback loops work

Laura Bacon - Omidyar Network
- Great that many members of the Alliance are ON grantees  
- Should link up with (Publish What You Fund & Development Initiatives) Joined Up Data Standards and SDGs

Elena Mondo and Claire Schouten - International Budget Partnership
Next Open Budget Survey to be published in September; new survey round launches in February/March 2016

They’ve started to think about users
- Drafting user profiles; interviewing them
- Can we present data in a better way? Medium-term discussion

Alan Hudson - Global Integrity 
- Reviewing strategy
- How can we build on our core strengths (cross-country comparative studies) to better support country learning?
- How can we link up with citizen produced data? 
- Data shift: http://civicus.org/thedatashift/ 

Ruy Moreno - Government of the Philippines  
- The government uses 10-12 reports to identify gaps in systems/processes
- Nathaniel Heller: GDA dashboard not producing new data; simply bringing together existing data, one-stop-shop presentation

Toby Mendel - Centre for Law and Democracy
- Impact is greatest with advocates pushing for changes before RTI laws are passed, not always assessing existing laws

Finn Heinrich - Transparency International
- Global Citizen Survey - trying mini-GDA; working with other barometers - learning lessons about partnerships
- Transparency and lobbying for the EU survey
- Open Governance Scorecard

Santiago Gonzalez and Jennifer Moreau - OECD
- New indicator on open data and trust in public institutions
- Continuing to work with the Effective Institutions Platform (EIP)
http://www.effectiveinstitutions.org/ 
- A few members of EIP asked to look at options for how to develop an effective institutions index 

Nathaniel Heller - R4D
- One piece of the Producers Coordination/technical assistance would be to provide advice/expertise through the GDA to “new” data producers
- OECD could link up with GDA producers on this

Alicia P. Mandaville - Amida Technology
- Focused on who else is using data (beyond just government), especially governance data 
- Private sector, for example - for investment decisions

Vanessa Tucker - Freedom House
- Looking closely at narrative part of their two global publications - how can we better explain/contextualize the data?
- Hoping to build a new database for Freedom House data

Valentina Saltane - Doing Business
- New survey on assessing public input on proposed government regulations
- Will circulate to whole group

Preston Whitt - OGP Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM)
- IRM data much more contextual
- There is a database - explorer; launched in next couple of weeks
- Want data to be used - GDA can be helpful 

Chris Maloney - MCC
- Excited about the dashboard 
- How can we be more public/external facing about the GDA - many stakeholders interested in this


**III. Next steps**

System moving forward: 
Let’s experiment with voluntary opt-in system: constitute smaller groups that are interested in particular pieces of work
- Producer coordination, training/help desk
- Feedback Loops
- Dashboard
- Governance and membership decisions 

Expectation that if you opt-in, you’re prepared to make contributions. Don’t opt-in if you don’t have time!
- We’ll send out messages to formalize this. 
- Designate key people/points of contact for different tasks/groups

Next step conversation for governance and membership - next Tuesday 
- Dig into some of the options previewed in the Vision Paper
- Re-read paper and come with an opinion

Alan: also will need to opt-in to joint data collection effort down the line

Nathaniel: start pushing forward with most work streams (except joint data collection) aggressively 
- We’ll likely need to develop mini work plans for different streams/deliverables

Logistics
- Streamline existing listserv
- Move from Global Integrity domain to something new/TBD 

Website/URL 
- We bought governancedataalliance.org/com - only issue is it’s long
- Other thoughts/alternatives? Nathaniel and Caroline will poll everyone.
- Toby: are we tied to GDA name?
- Nathaniel: no reason we can’t change, now, as long as the name remains somewhat specific (e.g. not simply super-broad “Data Alliance”)

Expect emails from Nathaniel & Caroline! And start thinking of which work streams you’d like to contribute to.
