These are notes the Alliance's May 19th, 2105 "Kick-Off Meeeting", the first since funding was secured for the Alliance. 


**1. GDA background and updates**
Three primary work streams to focus on in next 12-18 months (see existing “vision paper” for current baseline)

**   A.Producer-to-producer technical assistance**
- Problem: inadequate coordination, common challenges yet regular wheel reinvention
- Activities
  o Peer-to-peer help desk function
  o “Good practice” identification and dissemination (whether methodology-, technology-, or project management-related) 
  o Alliance data dashboard (see more below)

**   B.Feedback loops**
- Problem: producers don’t have a good sense of who data users are and what they need; users lack consistent means of signaling to producers; “marketplace” of governance data largely dysfunctional
- Main initial activities (led by AidData):
  o Mining AidData’s existing dataset (“Reform Efforts Survey 2014”) to draw out actionable information on existing governance data users (both in and outside of government)
  o Using survey sample frame/plumbing to do select “Snap Polls” of data users 

**   C.Experimental coordinated field work**
- Problem: inefficient, costly data collection (leading to inconsistent coverage); failing to take advantage of potential economies of scale
  • Likely will start in 2016 in 5-6 countries
  • It will involve experimental sharing of resources; striving for demonstrable efficiencies and cost savings

**   D. Data Alliance Dashboard**
- Problem: how to answer the complex question “How Zambia is doing governance-wise?” 
- The dashboard will provide a visual snapshot of existing Alliance member data (at least at the “country score” level).We will be able to 
  • say how a country is doing across a number of governance dimensions, above or below (world and/or peer 		cohort) median, over time 
  • offer downloadable snapshots (GIFs, simple csv files, etc.). 
- What’s needed to make a minimum viable dashboard happen:
  • Data harmonization: agreement on common publication format (e.g. common Alliance-specific spreadsheets)
  • Web development
  • Time to copy/paste existing data into new Alliance spreadsheets
- Dashboard will be key feature of GDA site (other parts will be simple: who we are; blog, etc.)
  • should dashboard provide just a snapshot or also link to broader research / in-depth diagnostic?
  • it would be useful to go beyond simple snapshot
  • we  should leverage feedback loop efforts to ensure that the dashboard is responsive to needs  (not just producer needs) 
  • we need to reflect how data collection can be built to make sure it’s useful to countries; including dashboard

**2. Updates from participants**
- Brad Parks, Rebecca Latourell, Samantha Custer/AidData 
  • implementation of the Reform Efforts Survey (since September)
  • have not yet studied attributes of users - working on that
  • how do you track institutional development/strengthening activities?
  • How do we leverage data to produce even better data in the long-term?
- Will organize a meeting to present the “market of ideas [Reform Efforts Survey]” report in DC in June
- Want to collaborate with people from GDA on the feedback loops work
- Laura Bacon/Omidyar Network
  • Great that many members of the Alliance are ON grantees  
  • Should link up with (Publish What You Fund & Development Initiatives) Joined Up Data Standards and SDGs
•	Elena Mondo and Claire Schouten/International Budget Partnership
o	Next Open Budget Survey to be published in September
o	New survey round launches in February/March 2016 - time for coordination 
o	They’ve started to think about users
•	Drafting user profiles; interviewing them
•	Can we present data in a better way? Medium-term discussion
•	Alan Hudson/Global Integrity 
o	Reviewing strategy
o	How can we build on our core strengths (cross-country comparative studies) to better support country learning?
o	How can we link up with citizen produced data? 
•	Data shift: http://civicus.org/thedatashift/ 
•	Ruy Moreno/Government of the Philippines  
o	The government uses 10-12 reports to identify gaps in systems/processes
o	Nathaniel Heller: GDA dashboard not producing new data; simply bringing together existing data, one-stop-shop presentation
•	Toby Mendel/Centre for Law and Democracy
o	Impact is greatest with advocates pushing for changes before RTI laws are passed, not always assessing existing laws
•	Finn Heinrich/ Transparency International
o	Global Citizen Survey - trying mini-GDA; working with other barometers - learning lessons about partnerships
o	Transparency and lobbying for the EU survey
o	Open Governance Scorecard
•	Santiago Gonzalez and Jennifer Moreau/OECD
o	New indicator on open data and trust in public institutions
o	Continuing to work with the Effective Institutions Platform (EIP)
•	http://www.effectiveinstitutions.org/ 
o	A few members of EIP asked to look at options for how to develop an effective institutions index 
o	Nathaniel Heller: one piece of the Producers Coordination/technical assistance would be to provide advice/expertise through the GDA to “newbie” data producers; OECD could link up with GDA producers on this
•	Alicia P. Mandaville/Amida Technology
o	Focused on who else is using data (beyond just government), especially governance data 
•	Private sector, for example - for investment decisions
o	Wants to keep private sector involved 
•	Vanessa Tucker /Freedom House
o	Looking closely at narrative part of their two global publications - how can we better explain/contextualize the data?
o	Hoping to build a new database for Freedom House data
•	Valentina Saltane/ Doing Business
o	New survey on assessing public input on proposed government regulations
o	Will circulate to whole group
•	Preston Whitt/ OGP Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM)
o	IRM data much more contextual
o	There is a database - explorer; launched in next couple of weeks
o	Want data to be used - GDA can be helpful 
•	Chris Maloney /MCC
o	Excited about the dashboard 
o	How can we be more public/external facing about the GDA - many stakeholders interested in this

**3. Next steps**
System moving forward
•	Let’s experiment with voluntary opt-in system: constitute smaller groups that are interested in particular pieces of work
o	Producer coordination, training/help desk
o	Feedback Loops
o	Dashboard
o	Governance and membership decisions 
•	Expectation that if you opt-in, you’re prepared to make contributions. Don’t opt-in if you don’t have time!
•	We’ll send out messages to formalize this. 
•	Within organizations, should we have someone else involved?
o	Designate key people/points of contact for different tasks/groups
•	Next step conversation for governance and membership - next Tuesday 
o	Dig into some of the options previewed in the Vision Paper
o	Re-read paper and come with an opinion
•	Alan: also will need to opt-in to joint data collection effort down the line
•	Nathaniel: start pushing forward with most work streams (except joint data collection) aggressively 
o	We’ll likely need to develop mini work plans for different streams/deliverables

Logistics
•	Streamline existing listserv
•	Move from Global Integrity domain to something new/TBD 
•	Website/URL 
o	We bought governancedataalliance.org/com - only issue is it’s long
o	Other thoughts/alternatives? Nathaniel and Caroline will poll everyone.
•	Toby: are we tied to GDA name?
o	Nathaniel: no reason we can’t change, now, as long as the name remains somewhat specific (e.g. not simply super-broad “Data Alliance”)

Expect emails from Nathaniel & Caroline! And start thinking of which work streams you’d like to contribute to.
