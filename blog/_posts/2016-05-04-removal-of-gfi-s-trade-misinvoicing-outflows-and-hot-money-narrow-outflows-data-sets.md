title: Removal of GFI’s “Trade Misinvoicing Outflows” and “Hot Money Narrow Outflows” Data Sets
---
Author: Joseph Spanjers
This blog post explains why we at Global Financial Integrity (GFI) had the Governance Data Alliance (GDA) remove our “Trade Misinvoicing Outflows” and “Hot Money Narrow Outflows” data sets from the GDA website. 
Global Financial Integrity submitted three data sets on illicit financial outflows from developing countries upon joining the Governance Data Alliance:
•	Illicit Financial Flows
•	Trade Misinvoicing Outflows
•	Hot Money Narrow Outflows
The trade misinvoicing and hot money narrow figures are the two components of measurable illicit financial flows; the two latter series are summed to generate the former.
We believe that our top-level data on illicit financial flows is the data set best-suited for the GDA dashboard; our trade misinvoicing and hot money narrow data remain available on GFI’s website for those interested. For users new to this subject, we know from experience that it can be overwhelming to have one new term to understand, let alone three. By limiting our data contribution to one series, we hope to streamline the appearance of our illicit financial flow data on the dashboard and alleviate potential confusion among first-time users.
