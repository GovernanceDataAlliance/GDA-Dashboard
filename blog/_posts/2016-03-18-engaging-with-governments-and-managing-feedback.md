title: Engaging with governments and managing feedback
---




Below are the notes from our first producers' workshop. The session, co-led by Finn Heinrich of Transparency International, Elena Mondo of the International Budget Partnership, and Johannes Tonn of Global Integrity, focused on engaging with governments, managing feedback, and making data collection more real-time



## I - Engagement with government
Tour de table: what are different groups’ current policies and practices around engaging government? 

**Johannes/GI **
- GI does not have a policy about engagement; it tends to be ad hoc, with some country engagement workshops

**Jesse/WRI**
For the Environmental Democracy Index (EDI):
- Before publishing the data, WRI sent results to all 70 governments with 4 specific questions
	- WRI shared the 99 indicators as well as summarized results and key take-aways
- Governments were given 2 months to respond 
	- WRI agreed  to take responses into account if they were helpful
	- WRI received 17 responses; most were substantive

**Melissa/WB **
For Doing Business:
- Governments are notified about changes in the methodology 
- They are not provided with the data for review
- They receive the embargoed report one week before its release
For newer products:
- Greater degree of government engagement

**Toby/CLD**
- Most government feedback is ad hoc 

**Alejandro/WJP**
- WJP does not engage with governments ahead of time
- There is engagement when results are released:
	- Specific ministries and government agencies receive customized press releases outlining strengths and weaknesses

**Joe Foti/OGP Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM)**
- A structured period exists during which government and civil society can comment
- A 3-tier system determines whether government feedback is taken into account or published
- There is an internal record of all comments; if they fit the criteria, they are published 
- There is then a public comment period 

**Preston Whitt/OGP(IRM)**
- There is also direct engagement with governments at the data collection phase 
- A trade-off exists: engaging with government can help improve the quality of reports, but it also creates expectations and disappointment in cases where comments are not included
	- Might this disincentivize partner governments from providing feedback?

**Toby/CLD** 
It is important to keep in mind that there are different types of data
- The importance of government’s involvement in the creation/review of the data varies depending on the data 
- For CLD government input is not a very important data source, as CLD is evaluating the quality of laws on the books 

**Joe/GFI**
- For GFI, most engagement comes at the end
- There isn’t much to dispute beyond the methodology 
Elena/IBP
- Organizations’ approach to government engagement depends on their mission
- IBP is very focused on its independence and ensuring that governments do not game the system
	- Ex. governments may publish data just before an IBP assessment, then backslide
- IBP sends questionnaire to governments and gives them a limited amount of time to provide feedback 
- IBP makes clear that it won’t necessarily take feedback into account
	- This sometimes annoys governments; this is often because they don’t understand the methodology
	- It would be useful to give them access to the methodology earlier on
- Question for Jesse/WRI - how is it possible to change assessment/scores once they are published? 

**Jesse/WRI-EDI**
- WRI was committed to making sure it got it right, in particular since it was EDI’s (Environmental Democracy Index) first edition.
- Beta version was launched to get feedback
	- All comments were made available; and WRI was transparent about why and how scores were changed 
	- At most these changes affected 4-5 indicators  
- This type of feedback process may not be possible in future iterations  

**Johannes/GI**
It could be useful to write up what different organizations do around government engagement; whether they have a formal policy around this; and whether it has been productive.

**Nathaniel/R4D** 
We should all map out how we currently engage government and/or how we intend to in the future, and why - such a matrix/listing would be a useful public resource

**Reasons to engage with the government may include:
1.	Ensuring scores are accurate
2.	PR/awareness raising
3.	Incenting behavioral change**

**Reasons not to engage may include not caring about government feedback and/or having a theory of change that focuses on civil society or the media as an audience/intermediary for pressuring the government**

**Alejandro/WJP**
Whether it makes sense to engage with government also depends on the organization, its context, and mission. It will be important to:
- Avoid oversimplifying the grid and inadvertently implying that engagement is necessarily desirable; that some organizations are more “open” or inviting than others 
- Make clear what each organization’s theory of change is, and why they do or do not engage with government
	- Articulate TOC in 3 sentences

**Toby/CLD**
- Important to highlight that it is not always useful to engage with government (depending on the type of data)

**Melissa/WB**
Important for the Bank to make sure that the data is accurate but also independent (even though the Bank is owned by governments)

## II- Continuous Feedback
**Finn/TI**
- A tradeoff exists around engagement and seeking/receiving feedback: the more you engage with government, the more you risk them gaming the system
- Important to distinguish feedback on the methodology as opposed to feedback on results 

**Elena/IBP**
- With the Open Budget Surveys, there are very limited opportunities for learning about / revising the actual methodology
	- It is not revised very often
	- IBP seeks input from experts rather than carrying out an open consultation about the methodology
	- Should IBP seek greater input about the methodology?
- We do some learning about the impact of the data we produce through case studies etc. 

**Johannes/GI**
- Global Integrity is currently looking at its methodology; content; feedback processes etc.
- Our question is how do we make indicators more actionable?
	- Moving toward more “action research” type model
	- This will involve more engagement with governments

**Nathaniel/R4D**
- There is a fuzzy line between engaging with government actively to make sure our data is relevant and actionable [while maintaining full independence] and becoming technical assistance providers who are overly responsive to government needs 
- Repercussions on credibility etc.

**Toby/CLD**
- Most engagement with government is around developing access to info laws which means that those governments are not yet on the CLD index

## III-Making data collection more real time

**Elena/IBP**
- Was anyone successful in speeding up their data collection and publication process?
- IBP uses a cut-off date and does not take information published after that date into account 
	- There is therefore a lag between data collection and publication
	- How do we make sure that our data is not obsolete very quickly?
	- There is volatility in the data – some documents are published one year, but not the next; so doing data collection only every 2 years is tricky

**Nathaniel/R4D**
There is a trade-off between making data real time and allowing for comparability across countries over time

**Joe/GFI **
GFI releases its report on an annual basis
- Could release data more often (monthly) by using STATA
- There is a concern, however, that if data is published more frequently, GFI would lose the impact of the currently concentrated once-a-year pressure on government as well as data comparability

**Nathaniel/R4D**
- How do we keep pressure on if you publish more often?

**Abhinav/OGP**
- Is there necessarily a need for more frequent data? 
	- Not always
- Dyntra, for example, tries to keep its roster of municipal open data updated constantly via web crawlers

**Jesse/WRI**
- What does real time data collection mean for governance data? 
	- As often as data changes?
	- As often as possible?
- It could be interesting to see how quickly governments make new data available; this could be an indicator of how willing governments are 

**Toby/CLD**
- Real time vs. continuous
- Keep in mind that datasets are of different types
	- This impacts what you can do/want to do
- CLD has sacrificed the annual press release “big bang” moment so that data can be updated more often – governments expect data to be updated more often
- It is probably not as important to update governance data as often as jobs data, for example [drawing a comparison to an earlier part of the discussion, which pointed out that certain monthly data could still attract and generate significant media coverage]

**Nathaniel/R4D**
- Are there some types of data that could be useful to have updated in complete real time? 
	- Hypothetical example: passive digital monitoring to see what the backlog of FOIA requests is on a given day or in a given hour? 

**Finn/TI**
- Some of this is happening at the country level, for example in Pakistan 

**Elena/IBP**
- It could be interesting to categorize organizations based on the type of data they collect and connect this to how often they can and should consider collecting data
	- Ex Dyntra; Instantaneous live updates when new doc made available

**Jesse/WRI**
- There is a cost-benefit analysis in deciding whether collecting data more often is useful and worthwhile, and whether there is a demand for it 
- WRI would like to publish more often but doing so would be very costly

**Toby/CLD**
- Didn’t see efficiencies one way or another (doing data updating more frequently or not)
- Continuous data updating helps with accuracy
- Comparability: CLD does not rely on a single point of comparison

**Elena/IBP**
- In 30 countries, IBP looked at just public availability as opposed to the content of what was made publically available
- It has been difficult to get researchers to respond every single month – though this has improved over time (learning curve)
- The question is how useful this is - most documents are published only once a year.

**Johannes/GI**
- Discussion at Feedback labs summit recently: making data real time is positive in and of itself

**Finn/TI - Wrap up**
- Many things determine whether/when an organization engages with government and how often they collect/update data
- Feedback on the workshop would be appreciated!

**Nathaniel/R4D - Next steps ** 
- Lots of learning and lessons emerging which would be useful to a broader audience
- How should we document this - through a blog post?
- What we all heard today: decisions around government engagement and frequency of data collection depend on the organization, the data, theory of change, etc. – It would be useful to give people a typology to think through these choices 

**Jesse/WRI**
- We could ask Francis at Vizzuality to talk through the EDI dashboard
