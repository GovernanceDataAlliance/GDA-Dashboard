What follows are the Governance Data Alliance's bylaws, including information about the Alliance's governance, and membership, among others.


The Governance Data Alliance (GDA or Alliance) is a network of national and international organisations and individuals, established in 2015 on the understanding that: 

- Governance data plays an important role in promoting sustainable development, good governance, democracy and respect for human rights. 
- Certain organisations and individuals play a critical role in the production and effective use of governance data, including to promote the goals noted above. 
- There is a need to continue to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of governance data, and the accessibility, and utility of governance data for existing and potential future users, as well as to promote efficiencies in the production of governance data.
- Networking of producers, users and funders of governance data can significantly facilitate the achievement of these needs.

These Bylaws are the foundational document for the GDA, setting out the ground rules which guide the development and growth of the Alliance, its planning and organisational processes and the spirit of its work. 

## Mission Statement

_**Vision**_: 

A world in which high quality, easily accessible governance data which meets the needs of users is available and is employed effectively to promote sustainable development, good governance, democracy and respect for human rights.

_**Mission**_:

The GDA will foster collaboration between organisations and individuals globally with a view to sharing ideas, exploiting synergies and learning from each other so as to enhance the production, utility and use of governance data. 

_**Core Values**_:

The GDA and its members are committed to the following core values: 

- Working together to improve the quality and relevance of governance data and the responsiveness of governance data to the needs of users.
- Operating in a transparent, accountable and collaborative manner.
- Engaging actively in the work of the Alliance in a spirit of respect for other members.
- Respect for human rights and democracy, human dignity and equality, including based on race, religion and gender. 

## Activities

The GDA’s activities include, but are not limited to: 

- Generally providing a forum for members to exchange information, experiences and lessons-learned, and to provide mutual support and assistance in relation to governance data activities.
- Fostering collaboration among data producers with a view to: 
    - identifying and exploiting efficiencies in the production of governance data;
    - setting minimum quality standards for governance data; and
    - enhancing the production of governance data in the sense of it being more comprehensive and of better quality.

- Strengthening the capacity of members in various ways, including in the ways noted above as data producers and so as data users can make better use of governance data.
- Identifying ways to strengthen feedback loops between governance data users and producers, and investing effort into understanding data users’ needs.
- Identifying and trying to address gaps in the production of governance data. 
- Raising awareness about existing governance data activities and the importance of governance data. 
- Coordinating the participation of the Alliance and its members in other governance data activities. 
- Providing support to Alliance members. 

## Structure of the Alliance

The GDA is comprised of members, the Steering Committee and the Secretariat. In addition, the Alliance may establish working groups on specific topics. 

## Membership

The GDA is a network of organisations and individuals which fall into three different cohorts – producers of governance data, users of governance data and funders of governance data – which subscribe to the GDA’s Mission Statement and which otherwise meet the rules regarding membership.

### **a. Types of Membership**

The GDA Membership consists of the three different types of members as follows: 

1. _Member Organisations_, defined as organisations falling into one or more the membership cohorts. Member organisations shall have one vote in steering committee elections and in relation to any matter that is put to a vote at a General Membership Meeting. Any individual affiliated with a member organisation may participate in the GDA discussions and activities, subject to the one-vote rule noted above. Any individual affiliated with a member organisation may stand for Steering Committee elections, provided that only one individual representing a member organisation may do so at any particular election. 
2. _Individual Members_, defined as individuals falling into one or more of the membership cohorts, provided that individuals who are formally affiliated with a member organisation may not join the GDA as individual members. Individual members may cast one vote for the Individual Member seat on the Steering Committee and in relation to any matter that is put to a vote at a General Membership Meeting.
3. _Observer Members_, defined as individuals who do not meet the conditions for membership or who do not wish to join as Individual Members but who have an interest in governance data. Observer members may participate in general Alliance discussions and activities but may not participate in Alliance voting or strategic discussions, or have access to Alliance funds.

### **b. Attaining Membership – Procedural**

1. Individuals and organisations who attended the original planning meeting on 15-16 April 2014 which led to the creation of the GDA may join the Alliance by extending an expression of interest in doing so to the Secretariat (to be referred to as the founding members).
2. The founding members may selectively invite key organisations falling into one of the membership cohorts to join during the interim period until the first Steering Committee has been elected. 
3. After the first Steering Committee has been elected, anyone wishing to join the Alliance as a Member Organisation or Individual Member shall apply for membership by filling out an application form, providing information about themselves and their activities in the area of governance data. The Secretariat shall undertake an initially screening of applications to determine whether the applicant appears to meet the conditions for membership. The Steering Committee will be responsible for creating a Membership Committee from among its members. The Membership Committee will adopt the membership application form and will review applications which have been screened in by the Secretariat and forward its recommendations to the Steering Committee, which will take the final decision on membership.
4. The Secretariat shall accept organisations and individuals as Observer Members, provided that it may refer any question in this regard to the Membership Committee for advice.
5. Members may be suspended or expelled from the Alliance by a two-thirds vote of the Steering Committee for failing to meet the substantive conditions on membership after a fair process in which the member is informed of the proposal to suspend or expel them and given an opportunity to make representations to the Steering Committee as to why they should not be suspended or expelled.

### **c. Attaining and Retaining Membership – Substantive**

1. All members are expected to sign and thereafter to respect the Mission Statement set out in Part 2 of these Bylaws and to uphold the principles contained therein.
2. Member Organisations and Individual Members are expected to undertake significant activities in at least one of the three areas of producing, using or funding governance data. It shall be up to the Steering Committee to develop, over time, a clear understanding of what constitutes governance data, provided that it is understood that this shall relate generally to the functions of government and that, while the GDA will not apply a rigid concept of data, some numerical or statistical element is required. It shall also be up to the Steering Committee to develop, over time, a clear understanding of what constitutes a governance data user, but it is understood that this goes beyond mere occasional use of such data.
3. Member Organisations and Individual Members are required to report annually to the Steering Committee on their governance data activities, in accordance with a basic template developed for this purpose by the Steering Committee, with the support of the secretariat.
