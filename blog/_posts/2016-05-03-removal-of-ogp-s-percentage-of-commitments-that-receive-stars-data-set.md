title: "Removal of OGP's \"percentage of commitments that receive stars\" data set"
---
## This blog posts explains why the OGP has decided to remove the "percentage of an action plan’s commitments that receive stars" data set from the Alliance website.


The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is proud to be one of the [founding participants](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/j-preston-whitt/2015/08/27/ogp-and-governance-data-alliance-marketplace-governance-data-broken) in the Governance Data Alliance.
 
Upon joining, OGP submitted three datasets that come from the organization’s data collection and review processes, mostly as part of the [Independent Reporting Mechanism](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/irm/irm-reports). These three original datasets were:
 
- The existence of a forum for [stakeholder consultation on OGP](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/attachments/OGP_Con_dur_imp (1).pdf)
- The number of [“starred commitments”](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/independent-reporting-mechanism/2015/05/06/irm-raise-bar-model-commitments-ogp) in an action plan
- The percentage of an action plan’s commitments that receive stars
 
However, since we submitted these three datasets, we realized that the first two are much clearer indicators for facilitating a competitive race to the top between OGP’s participating countries.  A multi-stakeholder forum is our current best proxy for an OGP-participating government’s commitment to collaboration with civil society (coupled, of course, with the more detailed information in the IRM evaluation).  The number of starred commitments helps identify the most potentially impactful open government commitments that see real progress towards changing citizens’ lives (identified through the IRM’s participatory but independent accountability process).
 
The percentage of starred commitments, however, does not lend itself so easily to useful analysis.   A score of 100% could result from having two stars out of two commitments, 20 out of 20, or 200 out of 200.  Instead, OGP’s stakeholders probably want to be able to identify the stories, effects, faces, champions, and outcomes of those commitments, rather than possibly misleading ratios.
 
For that reason, OGP has requested that the GDA remove the percentage of starred commitments dataset from its dashboard.  We hope the remaining two datasets serve the GDA community much better.  And of course, anyone who still wishes to analyze the percentage of starred commitments (or any other wonky analysis project) can still do so using the [OGP Explorer](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/explorer/landing).
