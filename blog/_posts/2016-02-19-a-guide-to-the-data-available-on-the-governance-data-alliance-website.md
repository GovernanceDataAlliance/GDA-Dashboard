title: A guide to the data available on the Governance Data Alliance website
---

The data available for download on the Governance Data Alliance website includes only top-level, national-level scores or ratings for countries. It does not currently any of the indicator-, category-, or question-level data that comprise the overall national ratings or scores from each data producer. To access this more disaggregated data, as well as further background information and analysis on each data set, please visit the respective data producer organization’s website (relevant links are included in the downloadable .csv files). The following is a full description of the metadata and data fields used by Alliance data producers to share their data in a consistent and comparable manner on the Governance Data Alliance website and via associated data downloads (.csv files) and API access.
