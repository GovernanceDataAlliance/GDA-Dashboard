Numerous organizations, including [members of the Governance Data Alliance](http://www.governancedata.org/about), collect and analyze data on the different dimensions of governance to help shape policy reforms and ultimately improve economic, human, and democratic development. Until now, however, we have had very little information (if any at all) about who uses governance data, and whether the data successfully inform and spur desired reforms. This lack of situational awareness has often led to inefficient investments in various governance data gathering activities and a poor understanding of their returns on investment. To address this information gap, the Governance Data Alliance commissioned AidData to produce a highly customized analysis unpacking the black box of who actually uses governance data at the country level, and what motivates them to put that data to work in practice. Building on AidData’s groundbreaking [2014 Reform Efforts Survey](http://aiddata.org/marketplace-of-ideas-for-policy-change) of nearly 6,750 policymakers and practitioners in 126 low- and middle-income countries, AidData’s new report for the Alliance,  [_Governance Data: Who uses it and why_, starts to answer some of these fundamental questions](http://www.r4d.org/sites/resultsfordevelopment.org/files/resources/gda_full_report.pdf). The report provides important and practical information about who governance data users are, how they use currently available data, and what makes governance assessments more or less likely to be influential at the country level.

This important piece of research will help fuel the Alliance’s ongoing work across several work streams moving forward. We’re grateful for the time and effort spent by the AidData team to prepare this seminal study and encourage everyone to read it.
