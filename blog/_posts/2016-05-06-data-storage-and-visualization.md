title: Data Storage and Visualization
---
Below are the notes from our fourth producers’ workshop. The session, co-led by Abhinav Bahl (Open Government Partnership), Jesse Worker (World Resources Institute), and Johannes Tonn (Global Integrity), focused on data storage and visualization.

## I. Data storage – Joe Spanjers, GFI
See slides!

## II. Data visualization I – Abhinav Bahl, OGP

- While making data available and accessible is important, it can be hard to convince funders to support this part of the work

**Jesse**

- Tracking the use of data visualization may be important to show its value (and to get funding for it) 

**Vanessa**

- In Freedom House’s experience infographics are what gets shared the most 

**Nathaniel**

- The theory of change underlying the production of data is tenuous: if you make data available, people will discover something awesome, and that discovery will spur beneficial behavior changes…

**Vanessa**

- What people want is raw, clean, and easily usable data and nice infographics 

**Melissa**

- The issue is that raw, clean, and easily usable are often in conflict

**Nathaniel**

- What we can make available are clean spreadsheet (instead of ahuge online tool) 

**Jesse**

- Many of us are offering both – both easily accessible visualizations and detailed data
- First try to catch people’s attention (with the visuals), hoping that they eventually look at the detailed data
Ashley Quarcoo
- Governments want the snapshot (rather than the details)

**Abhinav**

 - Perhaps money could be better spent building organizations’ capacity to understand and use the data (than on data visualization)

## III. Data visualization II – Jesse Worker, WRI

EDI offers both maps and the full data

A review of other producers’ sites shows the following:

- Most groups’ main visual are interactive choropleth maps 
- The idea is to allow CSOs, gov’ts to be able to see what others are doing well
- NRGI does not use a map
- Tables are another common tool, including for CPI
- IBP tracks change over time in its “timeline” rankings
- Some provide country-level data (WJP)
- Many rank performance 
	- IBP, WRI, etc.

WRI’s approach is “Empathize/explain/simplify”

- Empathize - understanding what audiences know and need (user testing to verify assumptions
- Explaining what you are providing
- Simplifying – de-cluttering to ease data use 

**Discussion**

**Nathaniel**

– Can we tackle the question of what users need, how we can better shape what we produce to make sure it is useful and used through our feedback loops work?
- It’s a key question for us – how do we make sure our data is usable and used

**Sam**

- We could look at this with mixed methods
- What do we need to draw people in, and then what do they use to make decisions?
- We could ask through snap poll, and then do experiments, offering different data presentations

**Alejandro**

- It depends on the audience
	- Some need just the rankings
	- Some want the details of what is happening in a given country
	- Some people want aggregate score, others want more disaggregated data; It can be hard to accommodate both
	- In the past, WJP has asked for feedback on what users prefer – and preferences are mixed!

**Melissa**

- For doing business, you start with aggregate/visual, then keep clicking in to get more details
- Some of the details available have changed over time – there was at some point, for example, a ranking predictor – but it was being misused and had to be removed

**Jesse**

- EDI uses a mix of visuals and stories

**Johannes**

- When is data visualization not helpful?
- We could use the design thinking approach to test that out

**Jesse**

- It’s important to explain your visual / what you’re showing 

**Johannes**

- Indices (and visualization) implies that there is a particular best practice we’re all striving for – which isn’t always true

**Jesse**

**A few resources for data visualization**

- www.datavizcatalogue.com
	- It is very useful if you’re thinking of using a new visualization tool
- www.D3js.org
	- Data driven documents

**A few recommendations**

- Make sure your visuals are easily accessible, and that they can be embedded
- Track who is using

**Johannes**

GI has different platforms managed by different companies, integrated with GI’s website
- It has caused some issues – but has also given us the opportunity to explore new tools

Mo Ibrahim commissioned an organization to create a huge spreadsheet

- It makes available everything that is on the web in a spreadsheet that you can share with people NOT on the internet
- Obviously, it is not as beautiful as some of the data visualization available on the web but it is an awesome tool 
- It allows you to include all the data for each of the products
- It can be shared with anyone
- People can then play with the data in the spreadsheet 
- It costs about 10-20K to build, but you can then keep reusing it
- Might the Alliance be interested in investing in something like this?

**Jesse and Santhosh** – many partners would find it useful to have a tool you can use offline 

**Nathaniel** – we could at least put all of the high-level data on the website into excel as a first way to test this type of tool 

**Have people tested the use of visualization?**

**Sam** - AidData has done some of this

- People are evenly split between preferring/using visualization, the full data set, and other things
- Experiments in a couple of countries – the results were quite different here, with people preferring static tools 

**Melissa**– the WB uses data to inform investment decisions

- Example: evidence that translated pages were not being used much led to those pages being cut. 

**Nathaniel** 

- Do we want to take some of these questions about visualization to the feedback loops workstream?
- Jesse – it would be great to have more evidence to back decisions about where to invest
- Abhinav-better understanding how the visualization leads to change would inform what we decide to visualize 

**Sam**

- It would be good to use the data we already have to see what we can learn 
- It would be great to interview data producers to understand their assumptions about data dissemination and use 

**Nathaniel**

- There is value in building the case for dissemination/visualization efforts – all of these groups have the experience that it is hard to fundraise for these things BUT that data production is not enough (building it will come, doesn’t work)
- We could use the Alliance to push this message
- We should do a brain dump of tools/tricks that people use
- Perhaps we could develop a 5-10 question surveys to an audience list
