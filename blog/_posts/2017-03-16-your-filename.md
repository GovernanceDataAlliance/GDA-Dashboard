title: Exploring Conceptual Overlap in Alliance Governance Indicators

Hi, my name is Dave and I'm one of the newest members of the Governance Data Alliance. I am an associate professor of political science at Western University in London, Ontario. I focus mostly on political methodology, specifically as it relates to measurement. 

As a member of the GDA, I wanted to try to contribute something to the project, recognizing that I am a user, rather than producer, of governance data. I thought it might be useful to apply the methodological tools I use to investigate the idea of governance. In particular, I wonder to what extent different governance indicators overlap with each other. That is to say, how much does knowing something about one governance indicator tell us something about others. This is something that can easily be evaluated using techniques common to measurement analysis, namely factor analysis.

As a bit of background, factor analysis proposes that there are, out in the world, concepts that are "real", but unmeasurable. Presumably, governance is one of those. We cannot hold up a ruler to each country and measure good governance, but we nonetheless think it is a real and useful concept. We can, however, capture proxies and correlates of good governance, but it is a concept that is difficult to capture in its entirety with a single measure. The model underlying factor analysis suggests that the reason that relationships are observed between indicators of the concept is because they both derive (at least in part) from a common cause (a single systematic source of variation) - governance. For example, factor analysis would suggest that to the extent that the Varieties of Democracy measures and Freedom House's Freedom in the World measure are related is not because there is a causal link between the two, but because they have the same common cause - governance. These models, or variants of them, are used to capture all sorts of things in political science - ideology of legislators based on roll call votes, positions of political parties based on expert coding or content analysis, citizen ideology, democracy, state repression, etc.

So, the question I attempt to answer here is - to what extent are all of the indicators of governance related to each other, to what extent do they share variance with this underlying unmeasurable concept of governance and to what extent are they distinct, separate from the other features. This also speaks to the idea that governance may be a multidimensional concept, unable to be captured sufficiently by a single concept or idea.

Before we talk further about the results, I want to say that the analysis here is not intended to identify "good" and "bad" indicators of governance, rather it is meant to evaluate overlap in currently produced indicators of governance. This could identify points of departure for different indicators and, perhaps, areas of the conceptual domain where empirical coverage is sparse. For example, if I found that corruption did not fit well with other indicators, it is not that corruption is not an indicator of governance, but that it is measuring a different part of the concept not captured by other indicators.

## **Findings**

The data suggest that governance, as measured by the current set of indicators, is largely unidimensional - in general, a single concept or idea captures the relationships among governance indicators. That is to say, that most of the indicators seem to share a good deal of variation with each other. The variables that do not tend to share this variation are not "bad" indicators of governance, but they are measuring aspects of the conceptual domain not captured by other indicators.

The goal here is to see how much of the variance in each of these variables is explained by the latent variable - governance. If the latent construct explains a lot of variance in the indicator, then that indicator helps define the construct. For example, roughly 90% of the variance in the Rule of Law Index is explained by the latent construct. The real, but unmeasured governance variable is very closely related to the Rule of Law Index. This means that rule of law is an important component of this dimension of the concept. On the other hand, whether or not there is an ongoing consultation forum according to the Open Government Partnership is not well-explained by the latent variable, meaning that this is tapping into another dimension of governance. Whether or not this sort of forum exists is more or less unrelated to the rule of law.

In general, if we were to try to understand what drives differences in governance, the "thing", for lack of a better term, that helps us distinguish between countries on this dimension, it might relate to accountability and predictability, along with and related to the protection of rights. Perhaps we might even call it stability. The  [Open Government Index](http://www.governancedata.org/indicators#OGI:2015) deals with access to information as well as the existence of (and participation in) mechanisms for accountability. The  [Rule of Law Index](http://www.governancedata.org/indicators#ROLI:2016) offers a look at perceived implementation of the rule of law and protection of fundamental rights and liberties as does, at least to some extent the  [Corruption Perceptions Index](http://www.governancedata.org/indicators#corruption_perceptions_index:2015). Both  [Nations in Transit](http://www.governancedata.org/indicators#Nations_in_Transit:2015) and  [Freedom in the World](http://www.governancedata.org/indicators#freedom_in_the_world:2015) deal with both perceived and realized threats to civil liberties and political rights. Both of the  [Doing Business](http://www.governancedata.org/indicators#doing_business:2016) indicators deal with regulation and regularization in business practices, something tantamount to the protection of property rights.

So, what is the takeaway from this exercise? First, there is a great degree of commonality among different indicators of governance. They tend to measure similar, though not exactly the same, aspects of governance. This does not necessarily mean that they set out to measure exactly the same thing, but that good governance on one measure tends to correspond with good governance on other measures. Perhaps the ambitious open government goals measured by the  [IRM](http://www.governancedata.org/indicators#irm_action_plan_count_star:2015) are simply too wide-ranging to be captured here. The key insight here is to consider the extent to which important indicators are not well captured by the latent concept and think about other potential measures that would tap the same underlying concept or idea. This could lead to a richer and more nuanced understanding of what governance means.
