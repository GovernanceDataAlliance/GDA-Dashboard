With the mounting concern around the “shrinking” of civic space in countries around the world, calls for recognizing and addressing the issue are multiplying. A number of indices and indicators have been produced to assess elements of civic space. But there have also been calls for a “civic space index” to more fully capture trends across countries. What are the current measures, and how do they address the concept of civic space? Are they the research tools we need to help fight back against closing space? If not, what more might be needed? How might new efforts complement existing tools? The Governance Data Alliance producers group discussed these and other questions at a workshop that took place on December 13, 2016.

## I. Introducing existing tools, particularly CSO SI and the Civil Society Monitor

**USAID’s  CSO Sustainability Index (CSO SI) – Jen**

+ In each country, a local implementing partner convenes a panel of 8-12 experts and informed observers
+ The Panel scores 7 dimensions of CSO sustainability (scores range from 0-7)
+ The implementing partners draft a country report based on scores and discussion and additional context information
+ The report is then reviewed and finalized by an editorial committee comprising ICNL, USAID, MSI, Aga Khan Foundation, and country/regional experts

**CIVICUS’ Civil Society Monitor - Cathal**

+ CIVICUS produced the Civil Society Index until 2012
+ In 2013, CIVICUS developed the Enabling Environment Index (EEI), a global composite index with 53 indicators categorized into areas and sub-areas
+ Ranked 109 countries 

**CIVICUS monitor**

+ The monitor is both a monitoring and an advocacy tool
+ It helps quantify, describe, and monitor the current reality of civic space 
+ It is produced by and for civil society (main audience)
+ It is constantly updated which is important given that these issues change rapidly

## II. Discussion
**Nathaniel Heller, R4D**
You can think of “civic space” rights and issues as belonging to two categories

+ Fundamental rights – of assembly, speech, expression etc. (rights recognized and enshrined in international norms and treaties)
+ More contemporary and more contested freedoms around the civil society operating environment – freedom to fund, receive funds, digital rights, etc.
+ Rebecca MacKinnon has done work on ranking digital rights, highly recommended research

**Cathal Gilbert, CIVICUS**
In some ways CIVICUS going back to the basic, “fundamental rights”

+ The Monitor looks at freedom of assembly, association, expression, and the state’s duty to protect
+ On top of those, the monitor looks at contextual factors

**Finn Heinrich, TI**

+ Is the term “civic space” too sanitized for what it refers to?

**Jen Stuart - ICNL**

+ CSO SI predates the term “civic space” – but helps capture some of it 
+ Measuring rules on the books is possible, but it is much harder to measure implementation of laws

**Melissa Johns, World Bank Indicators Group**

+ It is contentious and expensive to try to measure the implementation of laws
+ It will be interesting to watch the priorities of different data collecting institutions moving forward:
	- The World Bank’s leading shareholder is the US; will there be pushback on the Bank’s research agenda 
	- What will happen with USAID and DFID funding for data collection? 

**Gwen Bevis, MSI**

- CSO SI does not provide guidance on how to improve the state of civic space 
- Is this something that is missing, and that could be developed? Do we need to focus more on providing solutions rather than just diagnosing the problem?

**Sarah Rapaway, USAID**

+ One of the issue with CSO SI is that it is published a year after data collection 
+ This makes the Civicus Monitor particularly interesting and useful

**Alejandro Ponce, WJP**

+ The CSO SI scores are put together by a panel of experts – is this something people have criticized or tried to use as a reason to discredit the index?
+ The WJP collects information from people about their perceptions of civic space (not precise, but coming from the people through large-N surveys)
+ This might be an argument for better communicating our collective results and showing their complementarity

**Richard Murray, Mo Ibrahim**

+ Who are the encroaching agents / institutions? Are we tracking this?

**Gwen Bevis, MSI**

+ This would involve doing a political economy analysis of who wants the limitation of civic spaces and why
+ It would be controversial to do this but very important 

**Elena Mondo, IBP**

+ How would we prioritize what countries and institutions to look at?

**Gwen Bevis, MSI**

+ A next step would be to mapping of what already exists and identify the gaps

**Alejandro Ponce, WJP**

+ One question (which we’ve been asking as part of the Governance Data Alliance) is data for what? How do we think current and additional data would be used? 

**Jesse Worker, WRI**

+ WR was involved in Landmark, a mapping platform that provides information on the collective land and natural resource rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities around the world.
+ One of initiative’s stakeholders is a beverage corporation who wanted to know what community land rights were in reality (as opposed to what the government claimed)
+ A question for us is how can we better communicate this information to stakeholders who might serve as an alternative point of entry for our data?

**Gwen Bevis, MSI**

+ This all points to the fact that we should all do more with what we already have
+ USAID and others conduct very specific assessments of sectors (including political economy analysis) but many of these are confidential, and more specifically tailored to decision-makers.

**Jennifer Stuart, ICNL**

+ These assessments are very expensive and are most effective when they are done over the long-term
+ This is an argument for focusing on what is being done already rather than trying to create something new.
