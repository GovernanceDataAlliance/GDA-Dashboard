Below are the notes from our fourth producers’ workshop. The session, co-led by Abhinav Bahl (Open Government Partnership), Jesse Worker (World Resources Institute), Joe Spanjers (Global Financial Integrity), and Johannes Tonn (Global Integrity), focused on engaging with governments, managing feedback, and making data collection more real-time4th Producers workshop –  _02.29.16

Data storage – Joe Spanjers, GFI
See slides!

Data visualization I – Abhinav Bahl, OGP
Abhinav
•	While making data available and accessible is important, it can be hard to convince funders to support this part of the work
Jesse
•	Tracking the use of data visualization may be important to show its value (and to get funding for it) 
Vanessa
•	In Freedom House’s experience infographics are what gets shared the most 
Nathaniel
•	The theory of change underlying the production of data is tenuous: if you make data available, people will discover something awesome, and that discovery will spur beneficial behavior changes…
Vanessa
•	What people want is raw, clean, and easily usable data and nice infographics 
Melissa
•	The issue is that raw, clean, and easily usable are often in conflict
Nathaniel
•	What we can make available are clean spreadsheet (instead of ahuge online tool) 
Jesse
•	Many of us are offering both – both easily accessible visualizations and detailed data
•	First try to catch people’s attention (with the visuals), hoping that they eventually look at the detailed data
Ashley Quarcoo
•	Governments want the snapshot (rather than the details)
Abhinav
•	Perhaps money could be better spent building organizations’ capacity to understand and use the data (than on data visualization)

Data visualization II – Jesse Worker, WRI

EDI offers both maps and the full data
A review of other producers’ sites shows the following:
•	Most groups’ main visual are interactive choropleth maps 
o	The idea is to allow CSOs, gov’ts to be able to see what others are doing well
♣	Not always that easy 
•	NRGI does not use a map
•	Tables are another common tool, including for CPI
•	IBP tracks change over time in its “timeline” rankings
•	Some provide country-level data
o	WJP
•	Many rank performance 
o	IBP, WRI, etc.
•	WRI’s approach is “Empathize/explain/simplify”
o	Empathize - understanding what audiences know and need
♣	User testing to verify assumptions
o	Explaining what you are providing
o	Simplifying – de-cluttering to ease data use 

Discussion

Nathaniel – can we tackle the question of what users need, how we can better shape what we produce to make sure it is useful and used through our feedback loops work?
•	It’s a key question for us – how do we make sure our data is usable and used

Sam
•	We could look at this with mixed methods
•	What do we need to draw people in, and then what do they use to make decisions?
•	We could ask through snap poll, and then do experiments, offering different data presentations

Alejandro – it depends on the audience
•	Some need just the rankings
•	Some want the details of what is happening in a given country
•	Some people want aggregate score, others want more disaggregated data
o	It can be hard to accommodate both
•	In the past, WJP has asked for feedback on what users prefer – and preferences are mixed!


Melissa
•	For doing business, you start with aggregate/visual, then keep clicking in to get more details
•	Some of the details available have changed over time – there was at some point, for example, a ranking predictor – but it was being misused and had to be removed

Jesse
•	EDI uses a mix of visuals and stories

Johannes
•	When is data visualization not helpful?
•	We could use the design thinking approach to test that out


Jesse 
•	It’s important to explain your visual / what you’re showing 
o	It’s not always obvious!

Johannes
•	Indices (and visualization) implies that there is a particular best practice we’re all striving for – which isn’t always true

Jesse: 
A few resources for data visualization:
•	www.datavizcatalogue.com
o	It is very useful if you’re thinking of using a new visualization tool
•	www.D3js.org
o	Data driven documents
A few recommendations:
•	Make sure your visuals are easily accessible, and that they can be embedded
•	Track who is using

Johannes
•	GI has different platforms managed by different companies, integrated with GI’s website
o	It has caused some issues – but has also given us the opportunity to explore new tools
•	Mo Ibrahim commissioned an organization to create a huge spreadsheet
o	And makes available everything that is on the web in a spreadsheet that you can share with people NOT on the internet
o	Obviously, it is not as beautiful as some of the data visualization available on the web
o	But it is an awesome tool 
♣	It allows you to include all the data for each of the products
♣	It can be shared with anyone
♣	People can then play with the data in the spreadsheet 
o	It costs about 10-20K to build, but you can then keep reusing it
o	Might the Alliance be interested in investing in something like this?

Jesse and Santhosh – many partners would find it useful to have a tool you can use offline 

Nathaniel – we could at least put all of the high-level data on the website into excel as a first way to test this type of tool 

Have people tested the use of visualization?
Sam - AidData has done some of this
•	People are evenly split between preferring/using visualization, the full data set, and other things
•	Experiments in a couple of countries – the results were quite different here, with people preferring static tools 

Melissa – the WB uses data to inform investment decisions
•	Example: evidence that translated pages were not being used much led to those pages being cut. 

Nathaniel 
•	Do we want to take some of these questions about visualization to the feedback loops workstream?
•	Jesse – it would be great to have more evidence to back decisions about where to invest
•	Abhinav-better understanding how the visualization leads to change would inform what we decide to visualize 

Sam
•	It would be good to use the data we already have to see what we can learn 
•	It would be great to interview data producers to understand their assumptions about data dissemination and use 




Nathaniel
•	There is value in building the case for dissemination/visualization efforts – all of these groups have the experience that it is hard to fundraise for these things BUT that data production is not enough (building it will come, doesn’t work)
•	We could use the Alliance to push this message
•	We should do a brain dump of tools/tricks that people use
•	Perhaps we could develop a 5-10 question surveys to an audience list
