title: Research Design and Use of Data
---
Below are the notes from our third producers’ workshop. The session, co-led by the Centre for Law and Democracy (CLD), the International Budget Partnership (IBP), and the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI), focused on research design and the use of data.

## I - Research design and collection (Anjali, IBP)

- There are trade-offs between centralized and decentralized data collection
- Consistency/quality/credibility versus better knowledge of the country context
- Who conducts the research
	- IBP: the research is done by civil society (decentralized model, but all goes through center) - some people question the credibility of the results because it is done by civil society
	- CLD: all the research is done internally
	- WJP has a mixed approach 
- When groups opt for a decentralized data collection model, people often raise concerns about potential inconsistency, bias etc.
- Some ways to address this issue are:
	- Training of civil society partners
	- Peer review system
	- Checking results against other indicators 
- When groups opt for a centralized data collection model, those collecting the data may not understand what they are studying as well 
	- Importance of this varies - ex. CLD looking at laws, not as important to have country experts
	- Some things are harder to measure objectively (ex. IBP’s questions about participation and oversight institutions require input by in-country experts)
- NRGI: get pushed to look at “squishier” things like implementation etc., but those are harder to measure objectively 
	- There is a tradeoff here because those are the most interesting and important questions
- Jesse: for EDI, only a few indicators look at participation (for example: “was there participation in the last couple controversial laws?”). 
	- A number of different factors at play there - is there transparency? Is there demand? Fear of reprisals? Etc.)
- Toby: participation is one of hardest to measure (Number of people present?; Number of questions asked?, etc..)
-  Anjali: relatively easy to ask about whether a participatory mechanism exists, whether it has certain qualities – it is much harder to measure their effectiveness/impact

## II - Standardizing and comparability - Michael Karanicolas, CLD

The right to information presents particular challenges because it do not lend itself to quantification

- Tension between accuracy and precision; different legal systems deal with issues differently
- Example: right might be in constitution, but not protected that highly 
- Example: do they give you a receipt when you make a request for information?
- Is in law or not?
	- But then also in some places, it is not specified in the law, because in those places it is common practice to give a receipt for any administrative process
- Do you give points if not in Constitution?
- Straightforward seemingly questions like “is there is constitutional right to information?” are actually not yes/no - want to include gradations 0-5 as opposed to 0-1
	- This increases accuracy but hurts comparability between countries
	- CLD went with 0-1-2 rating. 0 no, 2 yes, 1 something, but imperfect
	- Brought in voluntary experts
	- Standardized formula

- GFI: do both global report and in some cases do country-specific deep-dive
	- Sometimes, learn new information in country-specific deep-dive, and need to adjust global report
	- Obviously, can’t do deep dives everywhere 
-  Nathaniel: AidData report finds that deep-dive reports are more influential
- CLD gets more buzz from rating 
	- Buzz may be different than influence on reform
- TI: sacrifice global comparisons with National Integrity System because adjust tool to specific country 
	- Still get pushed to make these comparable!

## III - Use of Data 

### 1.	Advocacy: trying to convince actors to change (Toby)

- For most of us, this one is most important use
- The audience is generally the government
- We work through intermediaries – civil society, the business community etc.
- Ratings are what get the most attention for CLD
- It is relatively easy to get the attention of the civil society community already working in this area
- It is much more challenging to get the attention from other more periphery groups, and convince them to make this issue central to their work 
- International organizations are reluctant to use ratings which is seen as “judging” countries
	- Similarly, it is easier to get attention of specialists within international organizations 
- Governments: some don’t care
	- We need to get the attention of groups that have more influence domestically (media etc.)
	- It is hardest to get the attention of countries in the middle of the pack
- It is also challenging to get the attention of businesses


### 2.	Technical assistance (Toby)

- We use data in all of our training workshops 
- Gaming issue - governments copy/paste specific parts into law
- Nathaniel:  “Middle of the pack” issue is a real one - how do we get attention beyond the top and bottom performers? 
- TI: countries that get attention are top and bottom, and countries that change over time.
- CLD: regional rivalry helps drive change beyond top and bottom
- Anjali: for OBI, reforms needed to improve scores in the middle of the pack are more complex than reforms needed at the bottom of the pack.
- Preston: on governments gaming the system
	- Ex. Guatemala - included 100 commitments such as “fight corruption” “get drug money out of politics” - not measurable
	- Ex. South Africa - consultations in villages; just explained what OGP was, didn’t explain how it might help improve situation 
- Toby: consultation is particularly different to measure/check - easier to “game”
- Business community - uses data but not necessarily as we’d like them to (influence government)
- Santhosh - TI: try to influence business; getting some attention from business targets 
- GFI founded on book “capitalism’s Achilles heel”
	- So want to influence business
	- Work with “B team” - billionaires interested in changing capitalism 
- Nathaniel: we hope business cares about corruption risk and make investment decisions based on that
	- Foglamp: turns out people don’t care that much (beyond wanting to avoid getting in trouble)
- Toby: risks vs. benefits - businesses build in cost of corruption 
	- Benefits may have greater attraction; openness good for business (This is one of the arguments OGP makes)
- Nathaniel: difference between publically traded companies  and those that sell to the public, and the rest - who are not as easily influenced by consumers
	- Predictability is what businesses look for - even if that includes paying bribes


### 3.	Research / Academics (Jason)

- Jason: why do we focus so little on academic audience 
- TI: the Global Corruption Barometer targets academics 
- CLD: interact with academics to some extent 
- Both CLD and GFI work with a small community of academics 
- Nathaniel: Academics want more countries covered by datasets for their research
- EDI: academics is a secondary audience, but there was not a huge push
- Jesse: assumption that academics have less policy influence; however, we do not necessarily have evidence of this
- Nathaniel: this bias exists and it may not actually be accurate, especially now, with the influence of academic organizations like IPA/JPAL
	- Perhaps academics should be a more central audience for our work
- Nathaniel: we could benefit from academics’ thinking and give them good research questions 
- Nathaniel: perhaps Alliance should reach out to academics to explore potential collaborations
- WJP has a consortium of scholars that convenes every couple of years
	- Some challenges there; they may want different information that we provide
- Jason: what might we include to make more our data more useful to academics? What do academics want:
	- Historical data (to assess patterns over time)
	- Objective data 
	- Clear top level message (strong abstract)
	- Accessible micro-level data - government need to understand how to improve governance
	- Emphasis on outcomes (what is impact of governance reform? Health? Growth?)
	- Multiple data formats 
- Toby: how can we use academics to help improve our indicators 
- Nathaniel: intrinsic vs. instrumental value of our data
	- We focus more on intrinsic value but researchers are more interested in instrumental value
	- A groups of organizations - including the Govlab at NYU, World Bank, R4D – is thinking about a research agenda trying to show impact of governance work on outcomes  

### 4.	Profile raising; fundraising
