**Agenda:**

+ Get through big items on membership and governance    

+ Solicit feedback  

+ Then put pen to paper at R4D, circulate options
for final outstanding issues, and ultimately craft draft bylaws

### **Membership**
  
Members vs. Observers

o  
Finn

§ 
No alternative, thinking about whether we need
observer status at all? Won’t we be doing most of our work in a way that’s
geared towards the public anyways?

§ 
Trying to understand the need to be “closed”
(e.g. members vs. non-members)

§ 
Capacity building activities are likely to be
open regardless

§ 
Not exactly sure what the contribution of
observers are – why aren’t they full members?

o  
Toby

§ 
For training and those sorts of things, fully
open to observers

§ 
Access to funding not open to observers

§ 
Thought there would be a lot of people who may
have a vague interest that could benefit from observer status

·      
Typology of members – producers, users, and
funders

o  
Nathaniel: Users is most fuzzy concept – will
need to take hand crafted approach for threshold of governance data “users”

o  
Toby

§ 
Issue is two-fold

·      
1) defining governance data – which we carefully
avoid doing until now, but will need to do that

o  
We need a procedural or process element to the
definition

o  
Need a primary definition of what governance
data is

o  
Need to distinguish ourselves from the wider
world of development data – may want to include some of this, but not all in
our definition

o  
“common law approach” to the definition –
something that we can interpret over time

·      
2) expect members to show some type of activity
– hard and soft ways of doing this

o  
Soft – i.e. submit a couple paragraphs each year
to explain how they’ve used governance data – if you can’t clear that, signal
that they might be a “zombie” member

o  
Rebecca

§ 
Producers – question on the type of variation in
data that they are producing? Speaks to question of what is governance data?

§ 
Nathaniel response – a way to narrow the
universe of producers (less about substance, more about technique) is around
primary data collection (of the current “pre-members” most are investing in
primary data collection – rather than aggregating data). Hope to offer up some
mainstream concepts of what governance data is or isn’t – taking big tent
approach, want to be inclusive

·      
How to apply in the future to become a member

o  
Nathaniel

§ 
We have some explicit criteria we will need to
flesh out

§ 
Need some sort of form or modality to document one’s
interest in alliance

§ 
Small membership committee, which is subset of
steering committee as first point of intake, who can recommend yes/no to
steering committee

o  
Finn

§ 
Makes sense – sounds familiar to membership
structure they have there (TI)

§ 
Secretariat could do an initial screening to see
if there’s enough of a fit so that membership committee doesn’t get overwhelmed

o  
Toby

§ 
We should have something ready for this by the
time we go live with the website – would be strange to have a website live
without info on how to apply

§ 
May need a membership committee before we
actually have a steering committee

§ 
Simple application form

§ 
What they have found in FOIAnet is that it’s
useful to have people on the membership committee that are either from or have
connections to other areas of the world – if you know prospective members,
easier to assess their potential fit

o  
Alicia

§ 
Being able to say what the process is as soon as
there is a public dimension is important (agree with Toby)

§ 
May want to stagger timeline in which someone is
participating in governing body or steering committee – have a second window in
which membership opens up again for those who weren’t involved in initial
conversations – use folks from the initial group for first window

o  
Nathaniel Question

§ 
Wonder if it makes sense to have membership
committee before steering committee? Also wonder if it makes sense to have
steering committee composed of members that have not been involved in the
brainstorming process?

§ 
Toby

·      
Depends on what the rush for new membership is
like

·      
Agree that it may be strange to have a steering
committee not composed of original steering committee members, but wonder if
there will be enough rush of new members

·      
How to recruit new members – by invitation? Or
otherwise? – if we use the first mechanism (invitation) may help eliminate the
worry of overwhelming the membership committee

o  
Invitation – Nathaniel

§ 
Several really great projects out there that we
probably could come to quick consensus on (i.e. Polity, Vdem)

·      
Geographic and other diversity

o  
Nathaniel

§ 
Based on past discussion, did not want to apply
mandatory ratios to diversity – but if we find there isn’t sufficient diversity
after a given amount of time, reassess

o  
Toby

§ 
If we’re talking about membership, not governance,
can’t refuse membership if not otherwise ineligible

·      
Individual vs. Organizational members

o  
Toby

§ 
As a group, discussed that there should be no
difference between members other than possibly voting rights

§ 
Individuals otherwise full members, including access
to funding

**Governance**

·      
Steering committee

o  
No comments on/objections to the idea of a
steering committee as the governing body

o  
Authorities/latitude that steering committee
should or should not have?

§ 
Toby

·      
Practically, we need to allow steering committee
to run most things, fairly broad powers that can reined in by the general
assembly/membership/whatever we want to call it

·      
Steering committee will operate within
constitution/bylaws

·      
Broad powers because this is the group that will
be discussing all issues, fully engaged and aware of them

·      
If we go to the members and a significant
percentage do not respond, not actually a good representation of membership

·      
Secretariat

o  
Nathaniel

§ 
Plan is for R4D will take this role for first
12-18 months, after that will reassess

§ 
The steering committee should not be chaired by
a member of the secretariat

§ 
Plan is to funnel funding through the
secretariat and disburse out – fine now, over time may become tedious
(important to watch over time)

o  
Toby

§ 
Need to talk about funding issues – if you have
a secretariat that is based in another organization 

§ 
Alliance may eventually form its own
organization – but not an early option obviously

§ 
Beyond bylaws, there may need to be some sort of
agreement between Secretariat and Steering Committee, particularly around flows
of funding

§ 
Questions on funding allocations – need to have
a transparent budget

·      
Fundraising

o  
Nathaniel

§ 
2 general types of funding opportunities:

·      
Unrestricted funding – pots of funding that
could be used by any member of the alliance for a variety of activities.
Unlikely to exist in practice but theoretically possible.

·      
Restricted funding: proposals put together by several
alliance members (or all, theoretically) that have been approved by steering
committee

§ 
What are the rules so that there is an equitable
chance for all to access funding?

§ 
Prohibition of using the alliance name in
external fundraising efforts?

·      
If you want to invoke the alliance to raise
money, have to first go to the steering committee to seek approval

·      
Want to make sure fundraising strategies are
consistent with Alliance strategy and intent 

·      
Don’t want to spam multiple donors with the same
requests for the same activities

o  
Toby

§ 
Procedural principle: cannot use Alliance brand
without approval of steering committee (agree)

§ 
Substantive principle: Also can’t use the
alliance to do work that is unrelated to the core alliance strategy and raison
d’etre

o  
Brad

§ 
Thinks those prohibitions make sense – cannot
use brand without steering committee’s approval

§ 
May make sense to have some decentralized
fundraising by multiple Alliance members, but must seek prior approval from
steering committee – could help extend reach and potential of Alliance

§ 
Conscious that those involved in the Alliance
have their own networks and may want to seek funding through them

o  
Alicia

§ 
May want to think more about where we get
funding from (particularly who we don’t want to take money from) – what is the
line we want to draw? Want to make sure that we have a base that we feel
comfortable with

§ 
Need to define the how we decide that, not
necessarily the what of who is beyond the redline

§ 
Nathaniel response

·      
Good idea to set up a process for how we work
out these case-by-case decisions

·      
So contextually difficult to decide what is a
legitimate vs. illegitimate funding source

·      
What’s most useful is to make sure that funding
ideas go through steering committee and that any members have an opportunity to
disagree with funding source and request a discussion – not sure if this is the
exact process, but something along these lines (get process nailed down, but
maybe not all criteria)

§ 
Toby

·      
Think that broad criteria for funding needs to
be set out somewhere – otherwise too much power granted to steering committee

·      
Agree that there is no set rule for “what is a dictatorship”
so difficult to define exactly who we will take money from, but need some loose
guidelines

§ 
Finn

·      
Agrees

·      
Also need to think about private sector funding
considerations which may be just as complex or problematic as country funding

·      
Regional/sectoral balance

o  
Difference between membership and governance –
may not want all steering committee members to come from the same place/sector

o  
Toby

§ 
Within FOIAnet, no strict rules – use proactive
measures to try to assure balance – open voting system – has led to
diversification of the board

§ 
Maybe have maximum quotas for regions/types of
groups – need at least so many from membership cohorts/different regions

§ 
Want to prevent undue dominance without over
engineering

o  
Finn

§ 
Question on approximate size of steering group;
15?

·      
Size of steering committee

o  
Finn

§ 
Based on previous experiences, difficult working
with group of more than 15 (thinks this is max) – but think we also can’t go much
below that given need for diversity of perspectives

o  
Nathaniel

§ 
In bylaws, could set a maximum, but allow it to
operate fully and freely as long as it’s under that max

o  
Toby

§ 
If you have an open vote, then the maximum is
what you have (because we can’t arbitrarily decide to limit “winning”
candidates)

§ 
Think 9, 11, or 13 is the right number (15 too
many)

§ 
Most meetings will be done virtually

§ 
Better to be practical rather than politically
correct

o  
Alicia

§ 
Err on the side of small to start

§ 
9 or 11 sounds most practical in terms of
allowing people to participate

·      
Power to make statements (as an Alliance)

o  
Toby

§ 
Puts less burden on org to begin with

o  
Once we have the bandwidth, may decide to scale
up to have the ability to make statements (but agreement now that it’s
difficult for multiple orgs to come to consensus on language)

·      
Voting

o  
Toby

§ 
Open voting for a position – Can divide
positions and within a division can have open voting (i.e. everyone votes for
the Africa position) or closed voting (i.e. only people from Africa vote for
Africa position)

§ 
Links back to question of how engineered the
steering committee is

§ 
Perhaps build into nomination process some
controls so that it’s not overly dominated by a specific cohort

§ 
One way or another, want to ensure some sort of
balance on steering committee

o  
Finn

§ 
Question on safeguards – what would these look
like in practice?

§ 
Don’t want a skewed representation of members –
need to think through clearly how we want to balance that

o  
Will depend on what type of vote we’re talking
about – i.e. elections for steering committees vs. any other votes that may
come up

·      
Individuals vs. organizations

o  
Are steering committee positions filled by
individuals or organizations?

o  
Brad

§ 
Why does it have to be binary?

§ 
Difficult for a scholar to have their university
sign up, but they could sign up and speak for what they want as individuals

o  
Toby

§ 
On the other hand, scholars (or other
individuals) are only speaking for themselves

§ 
Within FOIAnet, people sit on steering committee
as individuals, but have to be associated with an organization to be eligible

§ 
We could have set positions for both individuals
or organizations

§ 
Don’t think that by excluding individuals from
steering committee that it will necessarily limit the engagement of academics
in the alliance

o  
Finn        

§ 
Should be open to a mix

§ 
At TI they have organizational and individual
members – different rights, have a cap of number of individual members (for
membership, not board)

o  
Nathaniel

§ 
Original instinct was to strive for
organizational positions – but agree with Brad that it may exclude us from
important individuals, particularly leading academics

§ 
May want some rights that are only granted to
organizations rather than individuals

**Final thoughts/reactions**

·      
Preston

o  
Considering organizational members, think about how
design choices might impact of some of the “orgs” that may be good members –
For example, not sure how easy it would be for OGP [note: which is fiscally
sponsored by the Tides Center] to become a member of the Alliance (Nathaniel –
need to be creative and flexible here)

o  
For deciding exactly what governance data means
– need to define both “governance” and “data” (not just “governance data”)

o  
Toby response

§ 
Not just using data as a buzzword

§ 
Data is a concept, goes beyond numbers, but
there will be some restrictions to what we define as data

**Next steps**

·      
Nathaniel’s proposed next steps (over next
couple weeks)

o  
R4D will review and send out notes from this
call

o  
Circulate options on basic concepts/principles
discussed today – build consensus on these issues

o  
Once we have that consensus, return to crafting
draft bylaws/documents as necessary and circulate

o  
Quiet, proactive outreach for other orgs to
bring in now – develop pitch/summary (a little further down the line)

·      
Toby

o  
Think it will be more efficient to come to
conceptual agreement first and then draft bylaws
