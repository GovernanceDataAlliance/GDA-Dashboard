title: About the Alliance
intro-text: The Governance Data Alliance is a community of governance data producers, users, and funders committed to the effective production and use of high-quality data to advance democratic governance reforms in countries.

content-1-main: The Alliance came together in 2014 because we were collectively worried about the persistence of inadequate data assessing a range of governance dimensions in countries around the world, and the twin challenge of data producers often lacking insight into who the actual users of their data were. We strongly believed that no single organization could solve those problems alone, and that we needed a collective action response to strengthen the future production and use of governance data.

content-1-secondary: The Alliance is based on the assumption that while governance data has the potential to improve economic, human, and democratic development, the current state of governance data dramatically constrains its ability to produce positive change. We face a series of market failures&#58; the supply of data is highly irregular and ad hoc; feedback loops between governance data producers and governance data users are non-existent or under-employed; and production costs remain high and inconsistent despite possibilities for economies of scale.

content-2-title: What we do
content-2-text: The Alliance addresses these problems by facilitating coordination and knowledge-sharing among governance data producers, collecting and analyzing user data and behavior to enhance our collective understanding of target governance data usersâ€™ actual needs, and developing mechanisms to ensure that governance data producers are responsive to these needs. Our hope is that, together, these activities will&#58;

content-2-list-item-1: Improve the availability of governance data through greater coordination and user needs assessments.
content-2-list-item-2: Enhance the quality of governance data by establishing and promoting good practice research methods and data interoperability.
content-2-list-item-3: EEnhance the real-life use of governance data by identifying data users and targeting those users with what they actually want and need.
