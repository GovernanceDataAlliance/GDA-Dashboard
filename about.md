##### Numerous organizations collect and analyze data on the different dimensions of governance — ranging from corruption perceptions to fiscal transparency to business regulation and freedom of the press — to help shape policy reforms and ultimately improve economic, human, and democratic development. Unfortunately, the current state of the marketplace for governance data limits the potential impact of this information.

###### Data sets are available on various platforms in different formats. As a whole, they are also wildly incomplete, covering some countries and years but not others, and they are often produced with little to no understanding of who actually uses these data, and for what purpose. Additionally, production costs remain high despite possibilities for economies of scale. No single organization can solve those problems alone. We need a collective response to strengthen the production, use, and impact of governance data. This is why we formed the Governance Data Alliance.

## What we do

##### The Governance Data Alliance encourages greater coordination amongst data producers to fill data gaps while simultaneously investigating who governance data users actually are. The goal is to produce and aggregate high-quality but accessible governance data that policymakers and other change agents can use to take action. The Alliance’s work is currently organized around four work streams.

___

## Work streams
1. ### Knowledge sharing and collaboration among data producers.
This work stream supports peer exchange and technical assistance between groups within (and beyond) the Alliance on topics ranging from research methodology design and data analysis tools to data storage, data visualization techniques, and managing government feedback.

2. ### Publishing and promoting a governance data dashboard that aggregates high-quality data in one place: www.governancedata.org.
This work stream promotes improved accessibility, standardization, and use of existing governance data.

3. ### Collecting and analyzing governance data user habits and trends to better understand and meet the needs of those users in future data production efforts.
This work stream involves an analysis of responses collected through the 2014 Reform Efforts Survey as well as the collection of new data through novel “snap polls” focused on understanding future demand for governance data.

4. ### Piloting coordinated data co-production efforts to explore possible economies of scale.
This work stream aims to improve the availability of data, particularly for under-assessed countries, and to drive down the costs of data production over time.
