##### The Alliance came together in 2014 because we were collectively worried about the persistence of inadequate data assessing a range of governance dimensions in countries around the world, and the twin challenge of data producers often lacking insight into who the actual users of their data were. We strongly believed that no single organization could solve those problems alone, and that we needed a collective action response to strengthen the future production and use of governance data.

###### The Alliance is based on the assumption that while governance data has the potential to improve economic, human, and democratic development, the current state of governance data dramatically constrains its ability to produce positive change. We face a series of market failures: the supply of data is highly irregular and ad hoc; feedback loops between governance data producers and governance data users are non-existent or under-employed; and production costs remain high and inconsistent despite possibilities for economies of scale.

## What we do
The Alliance addresses these problems by facilitating coordination and knowledge-sharing among governance data producers, collecting and analyzing user data and behavior to enhance our collective understanding of target governance data users’ actual needs, and developing mechanisms to ensure that governance data producers are responsive to these needs. Our hope is that, together, these activities will:

* Improve the availability of governance data through greater coordination and user needs assessments.
* Enhance the quality of governance data by establishing and promoting good practice research methods and data interoperability.
* Enhance the real-life use of governance data by identifying data users and targeting those users with what they actually want and need.

## Work streams
1. ### Knowledge sharing and collaboration among data producers. 
This work stream supports peer exchange and technical assistance between groups within (and beyond) the Alliance on topics ranging from research methodology design and data analysis tools to data storage, data visualization techniques, and managing government feedback.

2. ### Publishing and promoting a governance data dashboard that aggregates high-quality data in one place: www.governancedata.org. 
This work stream promotes improved accessibility, standardization, and use of existing governance data.

3. ### Collecting and analyzing governance data user habits and trends to better understand and meet the needs of those users in future data production efforts. 
This work stream involves an analysis of responses collected through the 2014 Reform Efforts Survey as well as the collection of new data through novel “snap polls” focused on understanding future demand for governance data.

4. ### Piloting coordinated data co-production efforts to explore possible economies of scale. 
This work stream aims to improve the availability of data, particularly for under-assessed countries, and to drive down the costs of data production over time.
