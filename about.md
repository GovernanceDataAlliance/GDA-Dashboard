##### The Alliance came together in 2014 because we were collectively worried about the persistence of inadequate data assessing a range of governance dimensions in countries around the world, and the twin challenge of data producers often lacking insight into who the actual users of their data were. We strongly believed that no single organization could solve those problems alone, and that we needed a collective action response to strengthen the future production and use of governance data.

###### The Alliance is based on the assumption that while governance data has the potential to improve economic, human, and democratic development, the current state of governance data dramatically constrains its ability to produce positive change. We face a series of market failures: the supply of data is highly irregular and ad hoc; feedback loops between governance data producers and governance data users are non-existent or under-employed; and production costs remain high and inconsistent despite possibilities for economies of scale.

___

## What we do
The Alliance addresses these problems by facilitating coordination and knowledge-sharing among governance data producers, collecting and analyzing user data and behavior to enhance our collective understanding of target governance data users’ actual needs, and developing mechanisms to ensure that governance data producers are responsive to these needs. Our hope is that, together, these activities will:

* Improve the availability of governance data through greater coordination and user needs assessments.
* Enhance the quality of governance data by establishing and promoting good practice research methods and data interoperability.
* Enhance the real-life use of governance data by identifying data users and targeting those users with what they actually want and need.

## Work streams
1. ### Coordination and knowledge-sharing among data producers to improve the quality of existing governance data.
Often through the surfacing and sharing of good practice methodological and data gathering techniques. This work stream involves knowledge-sharing and technical assistance for groups within and beyond the Alliance through a basic “help desk” function, bi-monthly technical workshops, and resources addressing topics including research design and use of data; data collection and analysis tools; data storage, publication, and visualization; managing feedback; making data collection more real time; and engaging stakeholders including government.

2. ### Meet the needs of those users.
Potentially through the production of new and innovative governance data sets as well as improved presentation and packaging of existing data. AidData plays an essential role in this work stream, collecting and analyzing information about the needs and preferences of actual and potential governance data users. Their work includes an analysis of user data collected through the 2014 Reform Efforts Survey as well as the collection of new user data through innovative “snap polls” that make use of the Reform Efforts Survey sample frame around the world.

3. ### Piloting experimental co-production efforts to explore possible economies of scale between data producers.
In an effort to improve the availability of governance data over time.
