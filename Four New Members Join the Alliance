We are very excited to announce that four new members have formally joined the Alliance: 

+ [Bertelsmann Stiftung](http://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/en/our-projects/transformationindex-bti/), which produces their Transformation Index, among other governance data
+ [CIVICUS](http://www.civicus.org/index.php/en/), which produces various ratings assessing countries’ civil society operating environment
+ [Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem)](https://www.v-dem.net/en/about/), a leading dataset assessing democratic governance variables
+ [The World Wide Web Foundation](http://webfoundation.org/), an organization founded by Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee to promote a free and open Web and producer of the Open Data Barometer.

These organizations are leaders in the field of governance data; both existing and new members will benefit greatly from their involvement in the Alliance. 
  
The **Bertelsmann Stiftung's Transformation Index** (BTI) has analyzed and monitored the quality of democracy, market economy and governance in 129 developing and transformation countries on a regular basis since 2006. Assessments are based on comprehensive country reports authored by 250 experts from top international universities and think tanks. The BTI is the only cross-national index that measures governance quality through self-collected data and that provides an analysis of political management in transformation processes.

**CIVICUS** is an international alliance dedicated to strengthening citizen action and civil society around the world. The **CIVICUS Civil Society Index (CSI)**is a participatory needs assessment and action planning tool for civil society around the world, with the aim of creating a knowledge base and momentum for civil society strengthening initiatives. The CSI most recent phase 2003 - 2006 covered over 50 countries worldwide and is arguably the most encompassing picture of civil society ever produced.

The **Varieties of Democracy Project (V-Dem)** is an ambitious international effort to produce new indicators of democracy for all countries since 1900. With measures of democracy in great demand, V-Dem provides the global community with the world’s most comprehensive, accurate, and detailed democracy ratings. It seeks to capture seven different conceptions of democracy—participatory, consensual, majoritarian, deliberative, and egalitarian, in addition to the more familiar electoral and liberal democracy—in all countries since 1900. The different types of democracy are broken down into components and then into more than 400 specific indicators.

**The Web Foundation** aims to advance the open Web as a public good and a basic right. For the Web to enhance democratic participation in society, citizens need to access and reuse information freely. Through research, innovation and advocacy, we’re working to spark an open data revolution that will create opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs, drive innovation in public services and fight secrecy and corruption. Our [Open Data Barometer](https://opendatabarometer.org/) analyses the state of open data in 92 countries (with more being added each year) across a range of indicators aligned with the principles of the international [Open Data Charter](http://opendatacharter.net/) of which the Web Foundation is a lead steward.
